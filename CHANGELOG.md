# [2.0.0](https://github.com/prantlf/mv.js/compare/v1.0.1...v2.0.0) (2023-03-21)


### Bug Fixes

* Rename the bin script to mv-j ([f07aadf](https://github.com/prantlf/mv.js/commit/f07aadfd9d5cc45035fd93772170b55dced419d1))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The name of the executable changed from "mv.js" to "mv-j". I'm sorry
for that, but Windows mistake the suffix ".js" to a file extension and try execute it.
NPM creates the original file name too, probably to support Cygwin.
